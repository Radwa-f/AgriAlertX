temperature:
  high:
    low: |
      For {{crop}}, shade during midday and irrigate in early morning/late afternoon to limit stress.
    medium: |
      Heat stress expected for {{crop}}. Use shade nets, mulch to reduce evap, and avoid midday operations next 24–48h.
    high: |
      Extreme heat for {{crop}}. Prioritize emergency cooling (mist/evaporative), frequent light irrigation, and temporary shade.
  low:
    low: |
      Cool spell for {{crop}}. Light mulch to retain warmth; delay foliar sprays during dawn/dusk chill.
    medium: |
      Frost risk for {{crop}}. Use row covers/frost blankets overnight; irrigate before sunrise to buffer temperature.
    high: |
      Severe cold risk for {{crop}}. Protect with greenhouse/plastic tunnels; deploy heaters or anti-frost irrigation if available.

rain:
  low:
    low: |
      Drier than ideal for {{crop}}. Increase irrigation frequency slightly and monitor soil moisture.
    medium: |
      Drought stress likely for {{crop}}. Switch to drip/micro-sprinklers and apply mulch to conserve moisture.
    high: |
      Severe drought risk for {{crop}}. Initiate emergency irrigation schedule and prioritize high-value plots.
  high:
    low: |
      Wet conditions for {{crop}}. Improve drainage around beds; avoid waterlogging.
    medium: |
      Waterlogging risk. Open furrows/ditches; raise beds for {{crop}} if feasible.
    high: |
      Flooding possible. Create drainage channels, move containers/seedlings to higher ground, protect root zones.

humidity:
  high:
    any: |
      High RH favors foliar disease in {{crop}}. Improve airflow, avoid late overhead irrigation, scout for fungal symptoms.
  low:
    any: |
      Low RH increases transpiration for {{crop}}. Mulch and adjust irrigation to shorter, more frequent cycles.

ml:
  disagree: |
    Based on short-term conditions (T={{tmean}}°C, RH={{rhmean}}%, Rain={{rain}}mm, pH={{ph}}), consider trialing {{alt1}} ({{alt1p}}%) on a small plot; also viable: {{alt2}} ({{alt2p}}%).
