## Software architecture
![AgriAlertX Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b79aeae-16af-4497-bda9-58dd1286fbf0)                    
  
The application architecture uses Next.js for the web frontend, Kotlin/Swift for mobile clients, Spring Boot for the backend, and Flask for the chatbot service, with communication via RESTful APIs.

## Frontend

### Technologies Used
- Next.js (Web)
- Kotlin (Android)
- Swift (iOS)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Backend

### Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Flask (Chatbot)

## Backend Project Structure

The backend code follows a modular and organized structure, leveraging the power of Spring Boot for building a robust and scalable application.

### 1. com.example.demo
- *Main Application Class:* DemoApplication.java serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application. It includes the main method to bootstrap and start the application.

### 2. com.example.demo.controller
- *Controller Layer:* This package contains classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. Each controller defines RESTful endpoints for specific features or entities and delegates the request processing to the service layer.

### 3. com.example.demo.model
- *Entity Layer:* The model package includes classes representing data entities in the application. These classes use JPA annotations to define the structure of the corresponding database tables, ensuring seamless ORM mapping.

### 4. com.example.demo.repository
- *Repository Layer:* This package contains interfaces extending Spring Data JPA repository interfaces. These provide built-in methods for CRUD operations and enable interaction with the database without requiring boilerplate code.

### 5. com.example.demo.security
- *Security Configuration:* The security package includes classes for configuring authentication and authorization mechanisms. This might involve defining roles, managing user credentials, and securing endpoints based on roles or permissions.

### 6. com.example.demo.service
- *Service Layer:* This package contains business logic for the application. Services interact with the repository layer to fetch or modify data and provide processed information to the controller layer.

### 7. com.example.demo.utils
- *Utility Classes:* The utils package includes helper or utility classes that provide commonly used functionality across the application. These might include functions for validation, formatting, or other reusable logic.

### Additional Files and Directories:
- **resources Folder:** This contains application configuration files like application.properties or application.yml, along with other static resources.
- **Dockerfile:** Defines the steps to containerize the Spring Boot application for deployment.
- **pom.xml:** The Maven configuration file, managing dependencies and build configurations for the project.
- **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control.

This structured organization ensures the application is scalable, maintainable, and adheres to the separation of concerns principle.

## Getting Started
Here are step-by-step instructions to set up and run AgriAlertX locally:

### Prerequisites:

1. **Git:**
   - Ensure you have Git installed. If not, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **MySQL:**
   - Install MySQL Server.
   - Create a database named `agrialert`.
   - Ensure MySQL is running on port 3306.

3. **Node.js:**
   - Install Node.js (LTS version) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).


### Backend Setup:

1. **Clone the Project:**
   - Clone the repository by running the following command:

   - Build and run the application on your device or emulator.

2. **iOS:**
   - Open the iOS project in **Xcode**.
   - Update the API endpoint in the configuration files.
   - Build and run the application on your device or simulator.



### Chatbot Setup:

     ```bash
     cd chatbot
     ```
   - Install the required Python dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
